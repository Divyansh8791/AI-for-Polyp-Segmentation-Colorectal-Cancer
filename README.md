*A brief, engaging image description (optional).*

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model for polyp segmentation in colorectal cancer screening. Key highlights:

* U-Net with EfficientNet-B4 encoder (transfer learning for robust feature extraction)

* Dice + Focal Loss for effective handling of data imbalance

* Accelerated training with T4 GPUs on Google Colab

Achieves 70%+ Dice Score, closely aligning with clinical-grade performance.
## 📦 Dataset
Utilizes the **[Kvasir-SEG](https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir-seg/)**  dataset:

* 1,000 annotated colonoscopy images

* Expert-generated polyp masks

* Includes polyps with diverse shapes and sizes
